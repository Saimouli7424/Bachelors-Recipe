        Shred the mangetout, slice the mushrooms and water chestnuts, and mix with the shredded cabbage in a separate bowl to the onion mixture.
        Heat your wok until it’s really hot. Add a splash of oil – it should start to smoke – then the chilli and onion mix. Stir for just 2 seconds before adding the other mix. Flip and toss the vegetables in the wok if you can; if you can’t, don’t worry, just keep the vegetables moving with a wooden spoon, turning them over every few seconds so they all keep feeling the heat of the bottom of the wok. Season with sea salt and black pepper.
        After a minute or two, the vegetables should have begun to soften. Add the soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and stir in. After about 30 seconds the vegetables should smell amazing! Tip on to a serving dish, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and tuck in.

        For the filling, finely slice the cabbage and peel and julienne the carrot. Add these to a large bowl with the noodles.
        Slice the white part of the spring onions on the diagonal and add to the bowl. Finely slice the green parts into ribbons and reserve for later.
        Peel and grate the ginger, then finely chop the chilli. Roughly chop the herbs and add to the bowl with the ginger and chilli.
        Crush the peanuts and add to the bowl with the sesame oil, beansprouts, soy and oyster sauces, and mix well.
        When they’re ready, drain the mushrooms, then chop them and stir into the filling. Season to taste.
        In a small bowl, blend the cornflour and 2 tablespoons of cold water.
        Next, lay one spring-roll wrapper, smooth-side down, on a clean surface as a diamond shape, with one corner pointing down towards you. Sprinkle a little of the five spice powder over it, then place another wrapper on top (the extra thickness will stop the rolls from breaking open while cooking).
        Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling on the bottom corner of the double wrapper. Brush each corner with the cornflour mixture, then start rolling up from the bottom. When the filling is covered, pull the corners in from each side (to seal the ends as you go). Continue rolling until the filling is tightly covered, then press to seal the top corner.
        Lay the finished roll on a large baking tray and cover with a damp tea towel. Continue until you’ve filled all the wrappers.
        Heat the groundnut oil in a large wok or saucepan over a medium heat. To check whether the oil is ready, drop in a piece of potato; it should sizzle and start to turn golden. In small batches, carefully lower the spring rolls into the oil and deep-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
        Serve with the sweet chilli sauce and reserved sliced spring-onion tops.

        Place a large pan on a medium-high heat and toast the Szechuan peppercorns while it heats up. Tip into a pestle and mortar, leaving the pan on the heat.
        Place the chopped steak in the pan with 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil. Stir until starting to brown, then add the garlic, ginger, chilli, the white spring onions, carrots and mooli or radishes.
        Cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly, then stir in the chilli bean paste for 30 seconds until dark. Pour in the stock and simmer for 10 minutes.
        Meanwhile, drain the beans, put them into a pan with the rice and a pinch of sea salt, and cover by 1cm with cold water. Place on a high heat, bring to the boil, then simmer until the water level meets the rice. Cover and leave on the lowest heat for 12 minutes, or until cooked through, stirring occasionally.
        Taste the stew and season to perfection. Mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of cold water until combined, then stir into the stew.
        Trim and stir in the broccoli. Chop the tofu into 2cm chunks and drop them in, then pop a lid on and keep on a low heat for 5 to 8 minutes while the stew thickens up and the broccoli just cooks through.
        Serve the stew scattered with the sliced green spring onions, with the sticky rice and beans on the side. Finely crush and scatter over some Szechuan pepper. Nice with drips of chilli oil, to taste.

        Meanwhile, slash the chicken thighs a few times as deep as the bone, keeping the skin on for maximum flavour. Once the brine is cool, add all the chicken pieces, cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for at least 12 hours – I do this overnight.
        After brining, remove the chicken to a bowl, discarding the brine, then pour over the buttermilk, cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge for a further 8 hours, so the chicken is super-tender.
        When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5.
        Wash the sweet potatoes well, roll them in a little sea salt, place on a tray and bake for 30 minutes.
        Meanwhile, make the pickle – toast the fennel seeds in a large pan for 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Pour in the vinegar, add the sugar and a good pinch of sea salt, then finely slice and add the cabbage. Place in the fridge, remembering to stir every now and then while you cook your chicken.
        In a large bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder, cayenne, paprika and the onion and garlic powders.
        Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium to high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (180°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s a sign it’s ready to go.
        Take the chicken out of the fridge, then, one or two pieces at a time, remove from the buttermilk and dunk into the bowl of flour until well coated. Give them a shake, then place on a large board and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.
        Turn the oven down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and move the sweet potatoes to the bottom shelf.
        Once the oil is hot enough, start with 2 thighs – quickly dunk them back into the flour, then carefully lower into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry for 5 minutes, turning halfway, then remove to a wire rack over a baking tray.
        Bring the temperature of the oil back up, repeat the process with the remaining 2 thighs, then pop the tray into the oven.
        Fry the 4 drumsticks in one batch, then add them to the rack of thighs in the oven for 30 minutes, or until all the chicken is cooked through.

        Pull off the chicken skin, lay it flat in a large, cold frying pan, place on a low heat and leave for a few minutes to render the fat, turning occasionally. Once golden, remove the crispy skin to a plate, adding a pinch of sea salt and five-spice.
        Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 3cm chunks and place in a bowl with 1 heaped teaspoon of five-spice, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of cornflour and half the lime juice. Peel, finely chop and add 1 clove of garlic, then toss to coat.
        Next, prep the veg: trim and roughly slice the asparagus and broccoli at an angle, leaving the pretty tips intact. Peel the onion, cut into quarters and break apart into petals, then peel the remaining clove of garlic and finely slice with the chillies. Deseed and roughly chop the peppers, then peel and matchstick the ginger.
        Place the frying pan on a high heat and cook the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway, then leave on a low heat.
        Meanwhile, place a wok on a high heat and scatter in the pepper and onion to scald and char for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the peaches, pineapple, ginger, garlic, most of the chillies, the baby sweetcorn, asparagus and broccoli.
        Stir-fry for 3 minutes, then pour in the sauce. Cook for just a few minutes – you want to keep the veg on the edge of raw – adding a good splash of boiling water to loosen the sauce, if needed.
        Drizzle the honey into the chicken pan, turn the heat back up to high, and toss until sticky and caramelized. Plate up the veg and top with the chicken. Clank up the reserved crispy skin, and scatter over with the remaining chilli.
        Pick over the coriander leaves and serve right away, with lime wedges for squeezing over. Good with classic fluffy rice.

        Pour the spice mixture over the potatoes then gently mix together with a knife. Taste and season, if needed. Squeeze in the lime juice, add the spring onions and coriander, then mix together.
        For the dosa batter, add the flours to a large bowl with the bicarb, mustard seeds and a good pinch of salt. Gradually whisk in enough water, about 400ml, to make a loose batter.
        Drizzle 1 teaspoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat, then wipe around and away with a ball of kitchen paper.
        Add a spoonful of batter to the pan and immediately twist so the batter coats the base and slips up the edges. As soon as the moisture on top starts to cook away and there are lots of bubbles, add a few heaped teaspoons of potato filling and gently spread across the dosa.
        Once the base is crispy, loosely roll up the dosa in the pan and you’re ready to go. Delicious served with minted yoghurt, chutney and wedges of lime for squeezing over.

        In a small pan, dry roast the methi seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds and red chillies for about 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat, until you notice the seeds crackling. 
        Once done, turn off the heat and allow it to cool a bit and blend it into a smooth powder.
        Heat oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat; add the chopped onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies and saute until the onions are lightly browned and tender.
        Add the tomatoes, and saute until the tomatoes become soft and mushy. Once done add the chicken, the garam masala and turmeric powder. Add 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook the chicken for 3 to 4 whistles and turn off the heat.
        Once done, allow the pressure to release naturally.
        Make sure there are no stems when you pick the gongura leaves. Wash and chop the gongura leaves and keep aside.
        In another pan,add some oil along garlic and saute the chopped gongura leaves along with a little salt and the ground masala. The gongura leaves will wilt almost instantly. Saute the gongura in the masala for about 3 to 4 minutes until it becomes like a mushy paste.
        Once done, add the cooked chicken curry into the Gongura masala and saute on high heat for another 2 minutes and turn off the heat.

        "description": `Step 1 Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies
        To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.
        Step 2 Saute the onions
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish)
        Step 3 Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes
        Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
        Step 4 Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita
        Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. Enjoy!
